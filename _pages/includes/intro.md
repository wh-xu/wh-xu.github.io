I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher in the [Embedded Systems Laboratory (ESL) at EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/esl), working under the supervision of [Prof. David Atienza](https://people.epfl.ch/david.atienza). I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering from [UC San Diego (UCSD)](https://cse.ucsd.edu/), where I was advised by [Prof. Tajana Rosing](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~trosing/).
My research interests include a) emerging near-memory processing (NMP) architecture, b) RISC-V, c) hyperdimensional computing. 

Before joining UCSD, I received B.E. and M.E. degrees from [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/english), under supervision of [Prof. Chuan Zhang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Chuan_Zhang24) and [Prof. Yair Be'ery](http://www.eng.tau.ac.il/~ybeery). I finished a four-month research intern in [Intel Labs China](http://intel.com) where I developed the Flexible MIMO Processor for networks beyond 5G.
