I am a fourth-year PhD student in [SeeLab at UCSD](http://seelab.ucsd.edu/), advised by [Prof. Tajana Rosing](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~trosing/). 
My research interests include a) emerging processing-in-memory (PIM) architectures, b) near-storage computing system, c) hyperdimensional computing. 

Before joining UCSD, I received B.E. and M.E. degrees from [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/english), under supervision of [Prof. Chuan Zhang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Chuan_Zhang24) and [Prof. Yair Be'ery](http://www.eng.tau.ac.il/~ybeery). I finished a four-month research intern in [Intel Labs China](http://intel.com) where I developed the Flexible MIMO Processor for networks beyond 5G.
